Macro1 - POCDownloadImage.odt: This document countians a macro which get automatically executed when the document is open, it downloads a file from internet and save it in a file on disk. In this case the file downloaded is an image file from Wikipedia, which get saved in a file called archive.svg.

Macro2 - POCEnumAndSendBackResults.odt: This document countians a macro which get automatically executed when the document is open. The macro code downloads a PowerShell script called attackScript.ps1 from an attacker machine which gets executed in memory. This script acts as a dropper for downloading another PowerShell script called enumScript.ps1 from the attacker machine which perform some basic enumeration on the victim device. Then it encodes the result and send the result back to the attacker using a web request. The technique used in macro are realistic and stealthy as no artifact are left on the disk of the victim machine.

Macro3 - POC-msf.odt: This document countians a macro which get automatically executed when the document is open. The macro code downloads a PowerShell script from an attacker machine which gets executed in memory and act as a dropper for downloading another PowerShell script which execute a meterpreter reverse shell back to the attacker. The macro code and the powershell script is highly obfuscated to avoid that Windows Defender detect the odt file as malicious. The technique used in macro are realistic and stealthy as no artifact are left on the disk of the victim machine.
